Pilau Responsive Image Sizes
======================

Simple automated handling of responsive image sizes for WordPress

## Installation

Note that the plugin folder should be named `responsive-image-sizes`. This is because if the [GitHub Updater plugin](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) is used to update this plugin, if the folder is named something other than this, it will get deleted, and the updated plugin folder with a different name will cause the plugin to be silently deactivated.
